# asciidoctor-chunker

Splits asciidoc book's single HTML file generated by Asciidoctor into chunks by chapters.


*Note: This is a temporary implementation and still needs to be improved with respect to the speed.*


## What it Dose

Asciidoctor-Chunker generates chunked HTML from a single HTML generated by Asciidoctor.

1. Splits part preambles and chapters into separate files.
1. Places footnotes into the file where they are defined.
1. Re-writes the relative links to point the chunked files.
1. Copies the local images whose `src` is the relative path, to the directory relative to the chuned html output.  The images have to be reachable from the asciidoctor-chunker invocation directory.

Here is [the sample output](http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/~shito/asciidoctor/html_chunk/index.html) created from the [Asciidoctor User Manual](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/).


## How to Install

Asciidoctor-Chunker is written in Common Lisp.  The easiest way to install Lisp environment is to use [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell).

1. Follow [the instruction here](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki/Installation) to install Roswell.
1. Invoke `ros setup` after installation.  This will install Lisp compiler automatically and sets things up.
1. Place `asciidoctor-chunker` folder under `~/common-lisp` directory.
1. Run the script `~/common-lisp/asciidoctor-chunker/roswell/asciidoctor-chunker.ros` as follows.

```
$ asciidoctor-chunker.ros <single-html-file> -o <output-directory>
```

`<single-html-file>` is the single HTML file generated by [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) from the book doctype.  If the output directory is not specified, the default is `output` under the current directory.

## Example

The project contains the `test` directory where you can generate the chunked html for the [Asciidoctor User Manual](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/) by invoking `make`.  Simply go into the `test` directory and invoke `make`.  This will clone the asciidoctor project from the github for the first time, then the chunked html will be generated under `test/output-chunk/html_chunk/` directory.  The `index.html` is the first page.

```
$ cd test
$ make
```
